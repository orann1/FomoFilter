# Phase 17 — FMP Company Data Sync Migration

## Status

Completed

---

## Goal

Migrate the slow-changing company data workflow to FMP Starter in a clean, controlled, non-duplicative way.

This phase should implement the first real provider migration after the Admin Sync cleanup.

The target workflow is:

```txt
Company Data Sync
```

This workflow should gradually replace old fragmented sync actions related to:

```txt
Company profile
Fundamentals
Ratios
Growth
Analyst targets
Analyst recommendation counts
Earnings
```

The priority for this phase is to fix and migrate the most important company-level data first, especially:

```txt
FMP Analyst Target Consensus
FMP Price Target Summary as supporting recency data
FMP Profile refresh if safe
Finnhub recommendation counts retained
```

This phase should not migrate all fundamentals, ratios, statements, news, and daily data at once unless explicitly approved.

---

## Why This Phase Is Needed

Phase 16 cleaned the Admin Sync UI and reorganized sync actions into product-level workflows:

```txt
Universe Sync
Company Data Sync
Daily Market Data Sync
Score Calculation
Developer / Legacy Tools
```

Before Phase 16, the app had multiple development-era actions:

```txt
Sync Nasdaq 100 Market Data
Sync Nasdaq 100 Analyst Data
Analyst Target Discovery
```

These created confusion and duplicated responsibilities.

After purchasing and testing FMP Starter, we learned:

```txt
FMP Starter can provide most core company data.
FMP Starter works for Nasdaq 100, S&P 500, Russell 1000-like, and Russell 2000-like sample symbols.
FMP price-target-consensus works for all tested symbols.
FMP price-target-summary was previously mapped incorrectly.
Finnhub must still be retained for analyst recommendation counts.
```

The immediate data issue to fix is:

```txt
Phase 14/15 code reads targetMean, targetHigh, targetLow, targetMedian from price-target-summary.
These fields do not exist in price-target-summary.
They exist in price-target-consensus.
```

This explains existing rows where:

```txt
targetStatus = has_target
but targetMean / targetPrice is null
```

Phase 17 should start the real FMP migration by fixing this correctly and integrating it into the cleaned Company Data Sync workflow.

---

## Critical Product Decision

Do not build another patch.

Do not create another temporary target sync.

Do not duplicate existing StockAnalystData tables or fields.

Do not create a second analyst target table.

Do not create a new parallel sync mechanism.

Instead:

```txt
Refactor existing analyst target logic into Company Data Sync.
Use FMP price-target-consensus as the primary target source.
Keep FMP price-target-summary only as recency/supporting data.
Keep Finnhub recommendation counts for ratings/sentiment.
Reuse existing StockAnalystData.
Reuse existing SyncRun / SyncRunItem.
Reuse existing progress UI where possible.
```

---

## Scope

Phase 17 includes:

1. Audit current Company Data Sync and analyst sync logic.
2. Fix FMP analyst target field mapping.
3. Add/confirm FMP price-target-consensus provider function.
4. Use price-target-consensus as the primary target source.
5. Keep price-target-summary as secondary recency data if useful.
6. Keep Finnhub recommendation counts unchanged.
7. Update Company Data Sync behavior to sync analyst target + recommendation data.
8. Repair old invalid analyst target rows where safe.
9. Update Data Inventory, Scanner, Dashboard only if needed to reflect corrected target data.
10. Keep Developer / Legacy Target Discovery out of the main flow.
11. Preserve progress, history, and safe DB writes.

---

## Non-Scope

Do not build:

- Full FMP fundamentals migration.
- Full FMP ratios migration.
- Full FMP growth migration.
- Full financial statements migration.
- Daily Market Data migration.
- Historical candles table.
- Momentum Score.
- Analyst Sentiment Score.
- Opportunity Score v2.
- News/Catalyst sync.
- Earnings-based Catalyst Score.
- Intraday sync.
- New database tables unless absolutely required.

Do not remove Finnhub yet.

Do not remove the legacy target discovery code unless it is confirmed unused and safe to remove.

---

## Provider Strategy For This Phase

| Data Type | Provider | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Analyst target consensus | FMP | Primary |
| Analyst target summary | FMP | Supporting / recency |
| Analyst recommendation counts | Finnhub | Keep |
| Analyst upside % | Internal | Derived from current quote + target |
| Company profile | FMP | Optional if already safe |
| Fundamentals / ratios / growth | FMP | Future phase |
| Daily quotes | FMP | Future phase |
| Historical daily prices | FMP | Future phase |

---

# 1. Required Audit

Before implementation, inspect and report:

## Existing UI

```txt
src/components/admin/SyncPageClient.tsx
```

Check:

- Where Company Data Sync button is rendered.
- What action/API route it currently calls.
- What progress panel it uses.
- Whether it still calls old analyst sync or placeholder logic.
- Whether Developer / Legacy Target Discovery remains separated.

## Existing Sync Logic

Inspect:

```txt
src/actions/market-data-actions.ts
app/api/admin/analyst-sync/*
app/api/admin/analyst-target-discovery/*
app/api/admin/sync-runs/*
src/lib/data/admin-sync.ts
src/lib/data/admin-analyst-target.ts
```

Find:

- Existing analyst sync route/action.
- Existing target discovery route/action.
- Existing FMP target summary logic.
- Existing Finnhub recommendation logic.
- SyncRun types currently used.
- Which actions are still used by UI.
- Which actions are legacy only.

## Providers

Inspect:

```txt
src/lib/market-data/providers/fmp.ts
src/lib/market-data/providers/finnhub.ts
```

Confirm existing provider functions:

```txt
fetchFmpPriceTargetSummary
fetchFinnhubAnalystData
```

Add or fix:

```txt
fetchFmpPriceTargetConsensus
```

only if needed.

## DB Model

Inspect:

```txt
StockAnalystData
StockQuote
Stock
SyncRun
SyncRunItem
```

Confirm existing fields before adding anything.

Do not add duplicate analyst target fields if existing fields can store the data.

---

# 2. Correct Analyst Target Mapping

## Current Problem

Old code attempted to read from:

```txt
FMP /stable/price-target-summary
```

as if it returned:

```txt
targetMean
targetHigh
targetLow
targetMedian
```

But FMP Starter verification showed that this endpoint returns fields like:

```txt
lastMonthAvgPriceTarget
lastMonthAvgPriceTargetCount
lastQuarterAvgPriceTarget
lastQuarterAvgPriceTargetCount
lastYearAvgPriceTarget
allTimeAvgPriceTarget
```

The correct endpoint for main target values is:

```txt
FMP /stable/price-target-consensus
```

It returns:

```txt
targetConsensus
targetHigh
targetLow
targetMedian
```

---

## Required New Mapping

Use:

```txt
targetConsensus → primary target price
targetHigh → targetHigh
targetLow → targetLow
targetMedian → targetMedian
```

Recommended DB mapping:

```txt
StockAnalystData.targetPrice = targetConsensus
StockAnalystData.targetMean = targetConsensus if targetMean field exists
StockAnalystData.targetHigh = targetHigh
StockAnalystData.targetLow = targetLow
StockAnalystData.targetMedian = targetMedian
```

If there is no `targetMean` field and only `targetPrice`, use:

```txt
targetPrice = targetConsensus
```

Do not add new fields unless necessary.

---

## Summary Data Mapping

Use Price Target Summary only as supporting/recency data.

If existing DB fields exist, map:

```txt
lastMonthAvgPriceTarget
lastQuarterAvgPriceTarget
lastYearAvgPriceTarget
allTimeAvgPriceTarget
```

If no existing fields exist, do not add them in this phase unless clearly valuable and approved.

In this phase, the primary goal is to fix target coverage and target fields.

---

# 3. Analyst Upside Calculation

Calculate analyst upside internally.

Formula:

```txt
analystUpsidePercent = ((targetPrice - currentPrice) / currentPrice) * 100
```

Use:

```txt
StockQuote.price
```

If price is missing:

```txt
analystUpsidePercent = null
```

If targetConsensus is missing:

```txt
analystUpsidePercent = null
```

Negative upside is valid.

Do not fake zero.

---

# 4. Recommendation Counts

Keep Finnhub recommendation counts unchanged.

Reason:

```txt
FMP Starter analyst rating / grades endpoints returned HTTP 404.
Finnhub recommendation endpoint provides strongBuy / buy / hold / sell / strongSell for all Nasdaq 100 stocks.
```

Continue using:

```txt
Finnhub /stock/recommendation
```

for:

```txt
strongBuyCount
buyCount
holdCount
sellCount
strongSellCount
analystCount
analystRating / derived rating
recommendationPeriod
```

Do not replace this with FMP in this phase.

---

# 5. Company Data Sync Behavior

## Desired User-Facing Workflow

Admin Sync should show:

```txt
Company Data Sync
```

Button:

```txt
Sync Company Data
```

This button should run the current v1 company-data sync.

For this phase, v1 can include:

```txt
FMP analyst target consensus
FMP analyst target summary if useful
Finnhub recommendation counts
Optional profile refresh if already safe
```

Do not overload this with all fundamentals yet.

---

## SyncRun

Use a clear SyncRun type.

Recommended:

```txt
company-data-sync
```

or if existing sync run type must remain:

```txt
analyst-data-nasdaq100-sync
```

with display label:

```txt
Company Data Sync
```

Preferred approach:

- If changing the SyncRun type is low-risk, use `company-data-sync`.
- If changing the SyncRun type breaks history/progress/polling, keep existing type and update UI labels only.

Do not break Sync History.

Document the decision.

---

## Provider

For mixed provider sync:

```txt
provider = fmp+finnhub
```

This is accurate because:

```txt
FMP = targets
Finnhub = recommendation counts
```

---

## Progress UI

Preserve existing progress behavior:

```txt
current symbol
processed / total
success / skipped / failed
elapsed time
progress bar
final result
continue
restart
history
```

If the current analyst sync already has chunked progress, reuse it.

Do not create a new progress system.

---

# 6. Legacy Target Discovery Handling

The legacy quota-safe target discovery was built for the previous free/limited plan.

After FMP Starter, the main target workflow should no longer depend on it.

For Phase 17:

```txt
Keep it in Developer / Legacy Tools.
Do not show it in the main Company Data Sync workflow.
Do not delete it unless fully confirmed safe.
Label it as legacy/free-plan fallback.
```

Suggested label:

```txt
Legacy Target Discovery
```

Suggested note:

```txt
Legacy fallback for limited/free plans. Company Data Sync now uses FMP price-target-consensus as the primary target source.
```

---

# 7. Repair / Cleanup Existing Bad Target Rows

There are known existing rows where:

```txt
targetStatus = has_target
but targetPrice / targetMean is null
```

Cause:

```txt
Old code incorrectly mapped price-target-summary.
```

During the next Company Data Sync:

- If FMP consensus returns valid target data, update those rows correctly.
- Set targetStatus = has_target.
- Set targetLastFoundAt = now if relevant.
- Update analystUpsidePercent.
- Preserve recommendation counts.

If FMP consensus returns no data:

- Do not mark as has_target.
- Use appropriate status/message.

Expected after successful sync:

```txt
Target coverage should be close to 100% for active Nasdaq 100 stocks.
Old has_target/null target rows should be fixed.
```

---

# 8. Data Inventory Updates

Check current columns:

```txt
Target Price
Analyst Upside %
Analyst Rating
Analyst Count
Analyst Source
Analyst Last Synced
Target Status
```

Update if needed:

- Target Price should now use consensus target.
- Target High / Low / Median should display if already present.
- Target Status should reflect corrected sync.
- Source should show:

```txt
fmp+finnhub
```

or detailed source if available:

```txt
target: fmp
rating: finnhub
```

Do not add many new columns unless needed.

---

# 9. Scanner Updates

Scanner already displays:

```txt
Target
Upside
Rating
```

After migration, these should show real values instead of N/A for most stocks.

Required:

- No provider calls from Scanner.
- Scanner reads DB only.
- Missing values show N/A.
- Upside calculation comes from DB/internal sync result.
- Existing filters/sorts still work.

Optional:

- In expanded row, show:
  ```txt
  Target Source: FMP Consensus
  Rating Source: Finnhub
  ```

Do not redesign Scanner in this phase.

---

# 10. Dashboard Updates

Dashboard already shows target coverage and analyst data.

After migration:

- Target Coverage should increase significantly.
- Top Analyst Upside should show more real rows.
- No provider calls from Dashboard.
- No fake values.

Do not redesign Dashboard in this phase.

---

# 11. Score Methodology Update

Update notes if needed:

```txt
Analyst target data now uses FMP price-target-consensus as the primary source.
Price-target-summary is used only as supporting recency data if available.
Analyst recommendation counts remain sourced from Finnhub.
Analyst Upside is still display-only until Opportunity Score v2 is implemented.
```

Do not say Opportunity Score uses Analyst Upside yet.

---

# 12. QA Requirements

## Admin Sync

Open:

```txt
/admin/sync → Sync Actions
```

Confirm:

1. Company Data Sync section is visible.
2. Sync Company Data button runs the updated company-data sync.
3. Progress panel works.
4. Continue/Restart works if applicable.
5. Result shows requested/processed/succeeded/skipped/failed.
6. Sync History records the run.
7. Provider/source is accurate:
   ```txt
   fmp+finnhub
   ```

## Data Coverage

After running sync:

Report:

```txt
Total active Nasdaq 100 stocks
With targetPrice / targetConsensus
With targetHigh
With targetLow
With targetMedian
With analystUpsidePercent
With analystRating
With analystCount
Rows still has_target but null target
```

Expected:

```txt
Target coverage should be close to 100/100
Rows with has_target + null target should be 0 or clearly explained
```

## Data Inventory

Confirm:

- Target Price values appear.
- Analyst Upside values appear.
- Rating/count values remain.
- Source labels are accurate.
- Missing values are N/A, not zero.

## Scanner

Confirm:

- Target/Upside columns now show real values for most stocks.
- Sort by Analyst Upside works.
- Min Analyst Upside filter works.
- Expanded row shows analyst data.
- No provider calls happen from Scanner.

## Dashboard

Confirm:

- Target Coverage updated.
- Top Analyst Upside table has more real rows.
- Missing data remains N/A.
- No provider calls happen from Dashboard.

## Regression

Confirm:

- Universe Sync still works.
- Daily Market Data Sync UI still loads.
- Score Calculation still works.
- Analyst Target Discovery remains in Developer/Legacy Tools.
- Provider Tests still load.
- Scanner loads.
- Dashboard loads.
- Data Inventory loads.
- Score Methodology loads.

---

# 13. Validation

Run:

```txt
npm run build
npx tsc --noEmit
npx prisma validate
npx prisma migrate status
```

No migration is expected unless existing schema truly lacks fields for consensus target.

If a migration is needed, stop and explain why before adding it.

## History

- Initial Next.js setup: Cleaned up boilerplate by keeping only H1 in `page.tsx`, removed default CSS styles in `globals.css` while keeping Tailwind import, deleted default SVG files, committed changes, and pushed to GitHub repository.
- Planned dashboard implementation in multiple phases.
- Current feature defined as Phase 1: Dashboard Static Layout with Mock Data.
- Phase 1 completed (2026-05-11): Built full dashboard shell with sidebar, top bar, and all 10 widgets using mock data only. Installed lucide-react. Created `src/lib/formatters.ts` and all components under `src/components/layout/` and `src/components/dashboard/`. Polish pass: fixed Today's Signal copy, separated setup status from catalyst in mock data, changed logo accent to emerald, added bottom scroll padding. Build passes with zero TypeScript errors. Approved by user.
- Phase 2 completed (2026-05-12): Added right-side stock preview drawer. Clicking a row in `HotStocksTable` highlights the row and slides in a 520px drawer from the right. Drawer includes: sticky header (symbol, price, badges, close button), Decision Snapshot, Hot and Opportunity score cards, AI Insight, Price Context (mock SVG chart with timeframe pills), Score Breakdown (progress bars), Main Catalyst, Watch Context (watchlist vs non-watchlist states), and sticky CTA footer. Added `StockDrawerDetail` type and `mockStockDrawerDetails` to `mock-data.ts`. Created `DashboardGrid.tsx` as a client component managing selected stock state and close animation timing. Slide-in and slide-out animations registered via Tailwind v4 `@theme` directive. Row de-selects and drawer closes with exit animation when re-clicking the same row or pressing X. Build passes with zero TypeScript errors. Approved by user.
- Phase 3 completed (2026-05-12): Implemented drawer action flows — Add to Watchlist, Edit Watchlist, and Create Alert — as inline panels inside the existing stock preview drawer. Created `src/types/drawer.ts` for local state types. Created four new components under `src/components/dashboard/drawer/`: `AddToWatchlistPanel.tsx`, `EditWatchlistPanel.tsx`, `CreateAlertPanel.tsx`, and `DrawerSuccessMessage.tsx`. Updated `StockPreviewDrawer.tsx` to manage `activeDrawerAction` and `successMessage` state, render the active panel at the top of the scrollable area, update Watch Context from local state, and wire all CTA footer buttons. Updated `DashboardGrid.tsx` to hold `localWatchlistEntries` state and pass it down with callbacks. Updated `HotStocksTable.tsx` to accept a `watchlistSymbols` set so table stars update immediately when a stock is added locally. Drawer slide animation switched from CSS keyframe class-swapping (unreliable on persistent DOM elements) to a CSS transition approach using `translate-x` and `opacity` with a `requestAnimationFrame` mount trigger. Build passes with zero TypeScript errors. Approved by user.
- Phase 4 completed (2026-05-12): Made the existing dashboard and stock preview drawer responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile. Created `ClientAppShell.tsx` to manage mobile sidebar state and backdrop. Updated `AppSidebar.tsx` to slide in from the left on mobile with a close button, always visible on `md+`. Updated `TopBar.tsx` with a hamburger menu button on mobile and a second-row search input. Updated `app/page.tsx` to use `ClientAppShell`. Made `MarketStatsGrid` 2-column on mobile and `SummaryCardsGrid` single-column on mobile. Updated `DashboardGrid.tsx` to stack to a single column on mobile. Created `MobileHotStockCard.tsx` for mobile Hot Stocks display. Updated `HotStocksTable.tsx` to hide the wide table on mobile and show mobile cards instead. Updated `StockPreviewDrawer.tsx` to be full-screen on mobile (`fixed inset-0`) and right-side 520px panel on desktop. Added scroll-to-top behavior when opening a drawer action panel from the sticky footer using a `scrollContainerRef`. Build passes with zero TypeScript errors. Approved by user.
- Phase 5 completed (2026-05-17): Added Prisma 7 data layer foundation with PostgreSQL (Neon). Installed `prisma`, `@prisma/client`, `@prisma/adapter-pg`, `pg`, `tsx`, `dotenv`. Created `prisma/schema.prisma` with 13 models (Stock, StockQuote, StockScore, StockDrawerDetail, WatchlistItem, User, AlertRule, MarketStat, DashboardSummaryCard, DiscoverSetup, AiInsight, RecentAlert, plus enums). Configured Prisma 7 with `prisma.config.ts` (dotenv loading + datasource URL — required because Prisma 7 no longer supports `url` in schema.prisma). Created `src/lib/db/prisma.ts` as a singleton PrismaClient using `@prisma/adapter-pg`. Created `prisma/seed.ts` seeding all dashboard data (user, market stats, summary cards, 5 hot stocks with quotes/scores/drawer details, 3 extra stocks for top score changes, watchlist items, discover setups, AI insights, recent alerts). Created `src/lib/data/dashboard.ts` with `getDashboardData()` server-side loader. Updated `app/page.tsx` to be an async server component calling `getDashboardData()` and passing data as props; marked `force-dynamic` to prevent static pre-rendering. Updated all dashboard components to accept data as props instead of importing from `mock-data.ts` — type-only imports from `mock-data.ts` remain (types are still defined there); `TodaysSignalCard` still uses `mockTodaysSignal` as there is no DB model for the signal yet. Applied migration and seed to both dev (`ep-dry-river`) and prod (`ep-red-block`) Neon databases. Seed is idempotent (upserts by unique keys; AiInsight/RecentAlert/SummaryCard use deleteMany+createMany). Add/Edit/Alert drawer actions remain local-only. Build passes with zero TypeScript errors. Approved by user.
- Phase 6 completed (2026-05-18): Replaced local-only drawer actions with DB-backed Server Actions and Prisma. Created `src/lib/data/current-user.ts` with `getCurrentUserForDemo()` helper (looks up demo user by email, easy to swap for real auth later). Created `src/lib/validation/drawer-actions.ts` with Zod schemas for all four mutations. Created `src/actions/drawer-actions.ts` with four server actions: `addStockToWatchlist` (upsert via `userId_stockId` composite key), `updateWatchlistItem` (find by composite key then update by id), `removeStockFromWatchlist` (find then delete by id), `createAlertRule` (create with stock/user lookup). Prisma 7 enum values used as string literals with `as const` (Prisma 7 does not re-export enums from `@prisma/client`). Added `ActiveAlertRule` exported type and `alertRulesBySymbol: Record<string, ActiveAlertRule[]>` to `getDashboardData()` in `dashboard.ts`; the alert rule query runs separately after the 9-element `Promise.all` to avoid TypeScript tuple inference breakage at 10+ elements. Threaded `alertRulesBySymbol` through `app/page.tsx` → `DashboardGrid` → `StockPreviewDrawer` → `CreateAlertPanel`. Added "Alert Active" amber badge to drawer header when `existingAlerts.length > 0`. Added existing alerts list inside `CreateAlertPanel` with `formatAlertType` / `formatFrequency` helpers. Added Remove from Watchlist button at the bottom of `EditWatchlistPanel` (red-tinted text, trash icon, separate `useTransition` from save). All mutations call `router.refresh()` on success to reload server data; `DashboardGrid` syncs `selectedStock` from refreshed `hotStocks` prop via `useEffect`. No new Prisma models added, no migration created — existing Phase 5 schema was sufficient. Build passes with zero TypeScript errors. `prisma validate` and `prisma migrate status` both pass clean. Approved by user.
- Phase 7 completed (2026-05-18): Built the Scanner page foundation at `/scanner`. Created `src/lib/data/scanner.ts` with `getScannerData()` server-side loader using existing Prisma models (Stock, StockQuote, StockScore, StockDrawerDetail, WatchlistItem, AlertRule). Created `app/scanner/page.tsx` as a dynamic server component. Created 7 scanner-specific components under `src/components/scanner/`: `ScannerPageClient.tsx` (client state manager), `ScannerHeader.tsx`, `ScannerViewPills.tsx` (8 preset views: All Stocks, Hot Today, Strong Momentum, Best Opportunities, Unusual Volume, FOMO Risk, In Watchlist, Alert Active), `ScannerControls.tsx` (search input + sort dropdown + result count), `ScannerFilters.tsx` (Sector / Risk / Setup dropdowns + Watchlist / Alert Active toggles + Clear), `ScannerTable.tsx` (desktop 13-column table with hover and selected-row state), `MobileScannerCard.tsx` (mobile stock cards). Client-side filtering and sorting (Best Signal formula, Hot Score, Opp Score, Daily Change, Relative Volume, Analyst Upside, Symbol). Reused existing `StockPreviewDrawer` from the dashboard without modification — all drawer actions (Add/Edit/Remove Watchlist, Create Alert) work identically from the Scanner. Updated `AppSidebar.tsx` to use `usePathname()` and `Link` for dynamic active nav state so Scanner nav item highlights correctly. Added `showSearch` prop to `TopBar` and `ClientAppShell` (defaults `true`) and passed `showSearch={false}` from the scanner page to hide the redundant TopBar search on `/scanner`. No new Prisma models, no migration, no schema changes. No duplicate server actions. Build passes with zero TypeScript errors. `prisma validate` and `prisma migrate status` both pass clean. Approved by user.
- Phase 8 completed (2026-05-19): Added database-backed market universe support to the Scanner. Added `StockUniverseType` enum, `StockUniverse` and `StockUniverseMember` models to `prisma/schema.prisma`; added `universeMemberships` relation on `Stock`. Applied migration `20260519115623_add_stock_universes`. Updated `prisma/seed.ts` to create/upsert three system universes (Russell 1000 as `BASE_UNIVERSE` with `isDefault=true`, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 as `INDEX`) and assign all 8 seeded stocks to Russell 1000 with demo sub-membership (NVDA/AMD/TSLA → S&P 500 + Nasdaq 100, PLTR → S&P 500, SMCI/SOFI/KVYO/MHNI → Russell 1000 only). Seed is fully idempotent. Updated `getScannerData()` to accept `universeSlug` param (defaults to `russell-1000`), filter stocks by universe membership, include per-stock membership slugs, and derive `isSp500`, `isNasdaq100`, `isRussell1000`, `isRussell1000Only` flags — `isRussell1000Only` is computed, not stored. Scanner page reads `?universe=<slug>` query param and passes available universes and selected slug to the client. Added Universe selector strip (Globe icon, shows base universes, highlights active). Added Index filter dropdown (All Indexes / S&P 500 / Nasdaq 100 / Russell 1000 Only) to `ScannerFilters`; clear filters resets it to All. Added compact index badge below stock name in `ScannerTable` symbol cell and in `MobileScannerCard`. Added five optional universe fields to `HotStock` type in `mock-data.ts` (no dashboard impact). No external APIs, no real index import, no scoring engine, no price-eligibility rules. All existing scanner/drawer/dashboard behavior preserved. Build passes with zero TypeScript errors. `prisma validate` and `prisma migrate status` both pass clean. Seed idempotency verified by running twice. Approved by user.
- Phase 9B completed (2026-05-19): Built the market data provider layer and admin manual sync shell. Created shared provider types in `src/lib/market-data/types.ts` (`MarketDataProvider`, `ProviderTestResult`, `NormalizedQuote`, `NormalizedCompanyProfile`, `NormalizedNewsItem`, `SyncSummary`). Created three server-side-only provider clients: `providers/fmp.ts` (`testFmpProfile`, `fetchFmpCompanyProfile`, `fetchFmpAnalystTarget`), `providers/twelve-data.ts` (`testTwelveQuote`, `fetchTwelveQuote`, `fetchTwelveQuotes` batch), `providers/finnhub.ts` (`testFinnhubNews`, `fetchFinnhubCompanyNews`, `fetchFinnhubQuote`). All providers check for missing API key, handle HTTP errors, handle rate limits (429), normalize response shapes, and never expose keys. Created `src/actions/market-data-actions.ts` with five server actions: `testFmpProfileAction`, `testTwelveQuoteAction`, `testFinnhubNewsAction`, `syncQuotesSampleAction` (upserts `StockQuote` for up to 5 DB symbols via Twelve Data), `syncProfilesSampleAction` (updates `Stock.name/sector/marketCap` for up to 5 DB symbols via FMP). Raw provider response bodies stripped from action returns via `stripRaw()` before client serialization. Created `app/admin/sync/page.tsx` (server component, resolves key presence server-side) and `src/components/admin/SyncPageClient.tsx` (client, all 5 action buttons with loading states and result viewer). No schema changes, no new migrations, no existing files modified. `StockQuote.source` and `StockQuote.lastSyncedAt` intentionally not added — noted as a gap for Phase 9D. Build passes, `prisma validate` and `prisma migrate status` both clean. Approved by user.
- Phase 9C completed (2026-05-19): Added safe quote sync metadata, API key validation, and detailed sync reporting. Added `source`, `lastSyncedAt`, `sourceUpdatedAt` fields to `StockQuote` via migration `20260519144031_add_stock_quote_sync_metadata`. Created `src/lib/market-data/safe-update.ts` with `isValidNumber`, `keepExistingIfInvalid` helpers. Updated `src/lib/market-data/types.ts` with `SyncRunStatus`, `SyncSymbolResult`, `SyncActionResult` types replacing the coarse `SyncSummary`. Rewrote `src/actions/market-data-actions.ts` to use safe helpers and return per-symbol success/skipped/failed breakdown; each symbol update is atomic (partial success preserved). Rewrote `src/components/admin/SyncPageClient.tsx` with 4-step workflow layout, button descriptions, DB safety note, empty result placeholder, and clear updated/skipped/failed symbol lists. Added `Admin Sync` nav item to `AppSidebar.tsx` behind `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_ADMIN_TOOLS=true` flag with amber DEV badge and active state. Fixed FMP provider: all `/api/v3/` legacy endpoints return HTTP 403 for non-legacy users (deprecated after August 31, 2025) — replaced with `/stable/profile?symbol=` and `/stable/analyst-estimates?symbol=&period=annual&limit=1`; fixed field mappings (`marketCap` not `mktCap`, `exchange` not `exchangeShortName`). Build passes, `prisma validate` and `prisma migrate status` both clean. QA confirmed: Twelve Data quote sync OK, FMP profile sync OK (all 5 symbols), Finnhub news test OK, partial-success simulation OK, no duplicate rows, no API key exposure, dashboard/scanner/drawer regression clean. Approved by user.
- Phase 9D completed (2026-05-19): Added persistent sync logging for manual market-data sync actions. Added `SyncRun` and `SyncRunItem` Prisma models via migration `20260519191321_add_sync_run_logs`. Created `src/lib/data/admin-sync.ts` with `getRecentSyncRuns(limit = 10)` server loader. Updated `src/actions/market-data-actions.ts` with `persistSyncLog()` helper; both `syncQuotesSampleAction` and `syncProfilesSampleAction` now persist a `SyncRun` + per-symbol `SyncRunItem` rows on every run (including early-failure paths). Updated `src/components/admin/SyncPageClient.tsx`: renamed Step 4 to "Review Results", added Step 5 "Recent Sync Runs" — a table showing the latest 10 runs with green/amber/red status badges, counts, and click-to-expand symbol-level details (symbol, status, reason, dbAction). Updated `app/admin/sync/page.tsx` to load recent sync runs server-side and pass serialised to the client; `router.refresh()` called after each sync to keep the table current. Cascade delete on SyncRunItem. No API keys, URLs, or raw provider payloads stored. Safe update behavior unchanged. Build passes, `prisma validate` and `prisma migrate status` both clean. Full QA passed: schema verified, persist logic audited on all code paths, security confirmed, no regressions. Approved by user.
- Phase 9E completed (2026-05-21): Added universe management and Nasdaq 100 membership sync with Admin visibility and UX improvements. Extended `StockUniverseMember` with active/inactive membership metadata (`isActive`, `lastSeenAt`, `removedAt`, `source`, `statusReasonCode`) via migration `20260521135955_add_universe_membership_status`. Added a manually validated Nasdaq 100 static fallback source in `src/lib/market-data/nasdaq100-fallback-symbols.ts` with 100 unique symbols and explicit metadata (`source = static_fallback`, `compositionAsOf = 2026-01-20`, `lastVerifiedAt = 2026-05-21`); FMP and Finnhub live constituent endpoints were investigated but unavailable on the current plans, so FMP is used only for profile enrichment. Added `fetchFmpNasdaq100Constituents()` flow using the fallback symbols plus FMP profile enrichment, and added `syncNasdaq100UniverseAction()` to create missing stocks, create/reactivate/deactivate Nasdaq 100 memberships, persist `SyncRun`/`SyncRunItem` logs, and never delete stocks or modify watchlist/alerts. Created `src/lib/data/admin-universes.ts` with `getUniverseOverview()` and `getDbStockSummary()` loaders. Updated `/admin/sync` with DB Stock Summary, Universe Overview, static fallback source banner, and a `Sync Nasdaq 100 Universe` action. Manual QA confirmed the sync creates/maintains 100 active Nasdaq 100 members, preserves existing stocks/watchlist/alerts, stores `StockUniverseMember.source = static_fallback`, stores `SyncRun.provider = static_fallback`, and keeps profile enrichment separate from membership source. Added Admin Sync UX polish before commit: reorganized `/admin/sync` into four tabs (`Overview`, `Sync Actions`, `Provider Tests`, `Sync History`), added an in-progress panel for long-running write actions with elapsed timer and indeterminate progress bar, disabled duplicate submissions while sync is running, and kept all existing provider tests, sample syncs, review results, and sync history intact. Build passes, `tsc`, `prisma validate`, and `prisma migrate status` all clean. Approved by user.
- Phase 9F completed (2026-05-22): Added controlled Nasdaq 100 quote snapshot batch sync. Added `open`, `dayHigh`, `dayLow`, `previousClose` to `StockQuote` via migration `20260522062445_add_quote_ohlc_fields`. Added `getNextNasdaq100QuoteBatch(limit=25)` selector in `admin-universes.ts` (missing quotes first, then oldest `lastSyncedAt`, then symbol ASC). Refactored quote sync into shared `syncQuotesForSymbols()` helper reused by both `syncQuotesSampleAction` and new `syncNasdaq100QuoteSnapshotsAction`. New action uses Finnhub as provider (sequential per-symbol calls, safe update behavior, 429 detection), persists `SyncRun` with `type=quotes-nasdaq100-batch` and `provider=finnhub`, and persists `SyncRunItem` per symbol. Added `quoteRefreshCycleSynced` field to `UniverseOverviewRow` using a SyncRun running-total cycle boundary algorithm (scans batch runs oldest→newest, accumulates successCount, resets when total reaches activeCount — correctly tracks 25→50→75→100 progression). Admin Sync Actions tab shows new button with inline in-progress panel (appears directly below button, no scrolling needed). Overview tab shows two-part Nasdaq 100 coverage: Part A (quote coverage count, always visible), Part B (current refresh cycle progress, visible only when missing=0). Fixed Finnhub Unix timestamp conversion (`raw.t * 1000`). Build passes, `tsc`, `prisma validate`, and `prisma migrate status` all clean. Approved by user.
- Phase 9G completed (2026-05-22): Added Data Inventory tab to `/admin/sync`. Created `src/lib/data/admin-stock-data.ts` with `getAdminStockDataInventory()` — queries all stocks with `quote`, `score`, `universeMemberships` (including `universe.slug`), `watchlistItems`, and `alertRules` in a single Prisma query; derives `scannerEligible`, `missingReason`, `volumeSourceLabel`, and `quoteSourceLabel` server-side; formats all values as strings. Created `src/components/admin/DataInventoryTab.tsx` as a client component with: 6 summary cards (Total Stocks, With Quote, Missing Quote, With Score, Scanner Eligible, Nasdaq 100 Active); symbol/company text search; filter pills (All / Scanner Eligible / Missing Score / Missing Quote / Nasdaq 100); 24-column table with a two-row header (parameter name + source label). Columns cover Identity (Symbol, Company Name, Sector, Market Cap), Universe (Nasdaq 100, Univ. Source, Mbr Active, Mbr Last Seen), Quote (Has Quote, Price, Change %, Open, Day High, Day Low, Prev Close, Volume, Quote Source, Last Synced, Src Updated), and Internal (Has Score, Scanner Eligible, Missing Reason, In Watchlist, Active Alert). Volume is labeled `N/A` when null and `Mixed` when the quote source is Finnhub but a prior value exists — Finnhub is never incorrectly credited as the volume source. Tab order: Overview → Data Inventory → Sync Actions → Provider Tests → Sync History. No new Prisma models, no migrations. Build passes, `tsc`, `prisma validate`, and `prisma migrate status` all clean. Approved by user.
- Phase 9H-A completed (2026-05-22): Finnhub Basic Financials Research. Inspected `src/lib/market-data/providers/finnhub.ts`. Created and deleted a temporary script `tmp_research_finnhub.mjs`. No production code was changed. Tested endpoints `/stock/metric`, `/stock/price-target`, `/stock/recommendation`, `/calendar/earnings`, `/stock/profile2` on symbols AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMD, TSLA. Full findings below. No DB schema changes, no sync actions, no Scanner changes, no commits.
- Phase 9H-B completed (2026-05-23): Nasdaq 100 Quote + Basic Financials Sync. Added `StockMetric` Prisma model (28 Decimal? fields: growth, profitability, financial strength, valuation, market/risk context; `stockId @unique`; `provider`, `rawMetricCount`, `lastSyncedAt`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`) via migration `20260522154752_add_stock_metrics`. Added `fetchFinnhubBasicFinancials(symbol)` to `src/lib/market-data/providers/finnhub.ts` mapping 28 Finnhub metric fields with bracket notation for `totalDebt/totalEquityAnnual`, `52WeekHigh`, `52WeekLow`; Finnhub `marketCapitalization` (millions) multiplied by 1,000,000 before storing; percentage fields stored as-is (47.86 = 47.86%). Added `getNextNasdaq100MarketDataBatch(limit=25)` selector in `src/lib/data/admin-universes.ts` (priority: missing metrics → missing quotes → oldest metric sync → oldest quote sync → symbol ASC). Added `syncNasdaq100MarketDataAction()` to `src/actions/market-data-actions.ts` (type=`market-data-nasdaq100-batch`, provider=`finnhub`; 2 Finnhub calls per symbol — quote + metric; 500ms delay between symbols; stops on 429 rate-limit with partial-success persistence; safe-update pattern: create uses `safeNum() ?? undefined`, update uses `safeNum() ?? existingMetric?.field ?? null`; non-null assertion on required `price` field confirmed valid by preceding `isValidNumber` guard; persists `SyncRun` + `SyncRunItem` per symbol with per-field outcome messages). Extended `AdminStockDataInventoryRow` type and `getAdminStockDataInventory()` in `src/lib/data/admin-stock-data.ts` with 30+ metric fields (metric relation included in Prisma query; percentage fields suffixed with `%`; market cap formatted as `$X.XXB`). Updated `src/components/admin/DataInventoryTab.tsx`: added 20+ metric columns across Growth, Profitability, Financial Strength, and Valuation/Market sections with `Finnhub` source labels; added `Missing Metrics` filter pill; expanded summary cards from 6 to 8 (added With Metrics, Missing Metrics). Updated `src/components/admin/SyncPageClient.tsx`: added `Nasdaq 100 Market Data Sync` section in Sync Actions tab with metrics coverage panel; UX cleanup — removed old quote-only Nasdaq batch button from Sync Actions, removed Sample Sync from Sync Actions, added `Sample DB Writes` section to Provider Tests tab with inline progress panel. `syncNasdaq100QuoteSnapshotsAction` retained in `market-data-actions.ts` (internal use, not exposed in UI). Build passes, `tsc --noEmit` zero errors, `prisma validate` valid, `prisma migrate status` clean. Approved by user.
- Phase 9I completed (2026-05-23): Fundamental Score Foundation + Score Methodology Tab. Added 8 nullable fields to `StockScore` via migration `20260523153618_add_fundamental_score_fields` (`fundamentalScore`, `growthScore`, `profitabilityScore`, `valuationScore`, `financialHealthScore`, `riskContextScore`, `scoreVersion`, `lastCalculatedAt`). Created `src/lib/scoring/fundamental-score.ts` — deterministic scoring engine with 16 metric helper functions, `categoryAverage()` excluding nulls, weight re-normalization for missing categories, ROE cap at 60% and Interest Coverage cap at 30x (scoring only, raw values untouched), version constant `SCORE_VERSION = "fundamental-v1"`. Added `calculateFundamentalScoresAction()` to `src/actions/market-data-actions.ts` — no external API calls, skips stocks without `StockMetric`, upserts `StockScore` preserving existing `hotScore`/`opportunityScore`, persists `SyncRun` (`type=fundamental-score-calculation`, `provider=internal`) + `SyncRunItem` per symbol. Created `src/components/admin/ScoreMethodologyTab.tsx` — 6 sections: overview, category weights, 21-metric scoring rules table, caps/limitations, example calculation (score=72), future improvements. Updated `src/lib/data/admin-stock-data.ts` and `DataInventoryTab.tsx` to include 8 score columns with `Internal` source labels. Updated `SyncPageClient.tsx` to add Score Calculation section (Sync Actions tab) and Score Methodology tab (tab 6). Bug found and fixed during QA: Turbopack dev server had stale Prisma client cache from before `prisma generate` — fixed by clearing `.next/` and re-running `prisma generate`. Result: 100 stocks scored, 0 failed, 101 scanner-eligible, no duplicates, all scores in [0,100]. Build passes, `tsc --noEmit` zero errors, `prisma validate` valid, `prisma migrate status` clean. Approved by user.
- Phase 9J completed (2026-05-24): Resumable Chunked Market Data Sync. Replaced the old long-running Nasdaq 100 full sync (single server action, ~385s) with a scalable chunk-based architecture. Added `processedCount` and `currentSymbol` to `SyncRun` via migration `20260524061553_add_sync_run_progress_fields`. Created three new API routes: `POST /api/admin/sync-runs/start` (creates or restarts SyncRun), `POST /api/admin/sync-runs/process-next` (processes one chunk of 10 stocks), `GET /api/admin/sync-runs/latest` (polling endpoint, updated type). Removed old `syncNasdaq100MarketDataAction` batch server action and all old Next 25 buttons from the UI. Chunk size: 10 stocks per chunk (20 Finnhub calls). Rate-limit strategy: call-start pacing — ≥1100ms between Finnhub call starts (~54 calls/minute). Resume logic: `SyncRunItem` rows for the active `syncRunId` are the source of truth; unprocessed = all active symbols minus already-itemised symbols. Restart creates a new `SyncRun`; previous run remains in history. Auto-continue loop: UI calls `process-next` sequentially while `status === "running"` and `!done`; 2-second polling via `/latest` runs in parallel. ETA: `avgMsPerStock = elapsedMs / processedCount`; shows "Estimating…" until processedCount ≥ 2. Paused state UX: dedicated `PausedSyncPanel` shows paused-at timestamp (`finishedAt`), reason (`message` or fallback), last symbol, processed/total counts, amber progress bar, and guidance text. Rate limit message: "Finnhub rate limit reached. Continue the sync after waiting." Restart message: "Restarted by user before completion." No duplicate `StockQuote`, `StockMetric`, or `SyncRunItem` rows. Score calculation remains a separate explicit step. Scanner unchanged. Build passes, `tsc --noEmit` zero errors, `prisma validate` valid, `prisma generate` run to refresh client types. Approved by user.
- Phase 10 completed (2026-05-24): Scanner Real Data Integration. Moved `/scanner` from 5 demo/seed stocks to 100 real Nasdaq 100 stocks from the DB. Changed default universe from `russell-1000` to `nasdaq-100`; added `isActive: true` membership filter and `metric: true` include to the Prisma query. Added 4 formatter helpers to `src/lib/formatters.ts` (`formatScore`, `formatMetricPercent`, `formatRatio`, `formatCompactCurrency`). Extended `HotStock` type in `mock-data.ts` with 13 new optional fields for fundamental scores and key metrics. Rewrote `ScannerTable.tsx` with 18 real columns (Symbol, Sector, Price, Day%, Fund., Growth, Profit., Valuat., Health, Risk, P/E, PEG, Rev Gr., EPS Gr., ROE, D/E, Mkt Cap). Replaced sort options with 8 fundamental-focused keys; default sort is Fundamental Score descending. Removed Risk and Setup filters (not backed by real data). Reduced view pills to 3 active (All Stocks, In Watchlist, Alert Active); 5 unsupported pills (Hot Today, Strong Momentum, Best Opportunities, Unusual Volume, FOMO Risk) shown as disabled with "Coming soon" tooltips. Updated `MobileScannerCard.tsx` to show fundamental/growth/profitability/health scores and key metrics. Updated `ScannerHeader.tsx` subtitle. Dashboard audited — still uses `hotScore`/`opportunityScore` (= 0 for real stocks); deferred to Phase 11. No Prisma migration needed. No external provider calls added. Browser QA confirmed: 100 stocks loading (META top at Fund=89), all new columns visible with real values, N/A for missing metrics, disabled pills visible, dashboard unbroken. Build passes, `tsc --noEmit` zero errors, `prisma validate` valid, `prisma migrate status` clean. Known issue: universe selector strip shows "Russell 1000" button (only BASE_UNIVERSE type) with no active highlight since selected data is Nasdaq 100 (INDEX type) — UX improvement deferred to Phase 11. Approved by user.
- Phase 11 completed (2026-05-24): Scanner UX & Universe Selector Improvements. Fixed universe selector — Nasdaq 100 shown as active, Russell 1000 and S&P 500 shown as disabled "Coming soon" (backed by DB `hasData` count). Extended `HotStock` type with 20 new optional fields (detail metrics, score metadata, data freshness). Updated `getScannerData()` to map all new fields and compute `hasData` per universe via grouped Prisma query. Rewrote `ScannerTable` with score column tooltips (Info icon + title text), removed D/E and EPS Growth from main table, added expandable row chevron — clicking expands `ScannerExpandedRow` inline without opening the drawer. Created `ScannerExpandedRow` component with 6 grouped sections: Score Breakdown (progress bars + version + last calculated), Growth, Profitability, Valuation, Financial Health, and Data Freshness. Updated `ScannerViewPills` with 4 new active pills: High Fundamentals (≥75), High Growth (≥75), High Profitability (≥75), Reasonable Valuation (≥60). Updated `ScannerFilters` with 5 score threshold dropdowns (Any/50+/60+/70+/80+/90+) and Positive Day% toggle; exported `DEFAULT_FILTERS`. Updated `ScannerControls` with 5 new sort options (Risk Score, P/E, PEG, ROE, Revenue Growth — 13 total). Updated `ScannerPageClient` with new view/threshold filter logic, fixed universe selector rendering, improved empty states (no-match vs no-data). Dashboard deferred to Phase 12. No external provider calls, no schema changes, no Prisma migration. Build passes, TypeScript clean. Approved by user.
- Phase 12 completed (2026-05-24): Dashboard Real Data Cleanup. Fully replaced the legacy/demo dashboard with a real-data overview screen. Rewrote `src/lib/data/dashboard.ts` — removed all seeded-data queries (MarketStat, DashboardSummaryCard, DiscoverSetup, AiInsight, RecentAlert, hotScore-based ordering) and replaced with real Prisma queries across Stock, StockQuote, StockMetric, StockScore, StockUniverseMember, and SyncRun. New `DashboardData` type exports: `DashboardSummary`, `DashboardFreshness`, `DashboardStockRow`, `DashboardSectorRow`, `DashboardWarning`, `DashboardWatchlistItem`. Created 5 new components: `DashboardSummaryCards.tsx` (8 real cards: Total Stocks, Scanner Ready, With Metrics, With Scores, Avg Fundamental, Stocks Above 75, Last Market Sync, Last Score Calc), `TopFundamentalStocksTable.tsx` (top 15 by fundamentalScore desc, with score bars and sub-scores), `SectorSummaryTable.tsx` (avg fundamental/growth/profitability per sector, top stock per sector), `DataCoverageSection.tsx` (progress bars for quotes/metrics/scores/scanner-ready with capped 100% display and "+N rows outside universe" note), `DataWarningsSection.tsx` (amber warnings for missing sync, missing metrics, missing scores, stale scores). Updated `DashboardHeader.tsx` (new subtitle), `DashboardGrid.tsx` (removed legacy widgets, wired new components), `WatchlistWidget.tsx` (shows fundamentalScore instead of hot/opp, uses `DashboardWatchlistItem` type), `app/page.tsx` (removed TodaysSignalCard, MarketStatsGrid, old SummaryCardsGrid; added new components). No Prisma migration added. No external provider calls. No scoring formula changes. Browser QA confirmed: 100 stocks, META top at Fund=89, all legacy fields absent, data warnings functional, coverage bars capped at 100%, sector summary present, watchlist shows Fund scores, Scanner and Admin Sync unbroken. Build passes, `tsc --noEmit` zero errors, `prisma validate` valid, `prisma migrate status` clean. Approved by user.
- Phase 13 completed (2026-05-24): Opportunity Score v1. Added `oppScore Decimal?`, `oppScoreVersion String?`, `oppCalculatedAt DateTime?` to `StockScore` via migration `20260524135513_add_opportunity_score_fields`. Created `src/lib/scoring/opportunity-score.ts` — deterministic scoring engine with weighted average (fundamentalScore 35%, valuationScore 30%, growthScore 20%, riskContextScore 10%, pricePosition 5%), null-exclusion with weight re-normalization for missing components, price position scoring from 52W high/low (`(price - week52Low) / (week52High - week52Low)` → scored 30–100), version constant `OPPORTUNITY_SCORE_VERSION = "opportunity-v1"`. Added `calculateOpportunityScoresAction()` to `src/actions/market-data-actions.ts` — no external calls, skips stocks without fundamentalScore, upserts `StockScore.oppScore`, persists `SyncRun` (`type=opportunity-score-calculation`, `provider=internal`) + `SyncRunItem` per symbol. Fixed Turbopack stale cache bug (same as Phase 9I): cleared `.next/` and re-ran `prisma generate` before QA. Admin Sync Actions tab: added "Calculate Opportunity Scores" button with helper text and Internal badge. Score Methodology tab: added Opportunity Score v1 section with weights, price position table, missing data rules, version. Data Inventory: added Opp. Score, Opp. Version, Opp. Calc At columns. Scanner: added Opp. column (between Day% and Fund.), sort by Opportunity Score, "High Opportunity" pill (≥75), "Min Opp." threshold filter, expanded row shows Opportunity Score section with formula explanation. Dashboard: added "Avg Opportunity" and "High Opportunity" summary cards; added Opp. column to Top Fundamental Stocks table. No external provider calls added. Build passes, `tsc --noEmit` zero errors, `prisma validate` valid, `prisma migrate status` clean. Approved by user.
- Phase 14 completed (2026-05-26): Analyst Data & Upside Integration. Added `StockAnalystData` Prisma model (targetPrice, analystUpsidePercent, analystRating, analystCount, targetHigh, targetLow, targetMedian, targetMean, strongBuy/buy/hold/sell/strongSell counts, source, lastSyncedAt, sourceUpdatedAt) via migration `20260525182611_add_stock_analyst_data`. Provider strategy: FMP `/stable/price-target-summary` for price targets (returns array — parsed correctly), Finnhub `/stock/recommendation` for analyst counts and derived rating; source stored as `fmp+finnhub`. Added `MarketDataProvider` union type extended to include `"fmp+finnhub"`. Created three chunked sync API routes: `POST /api/admin/analyst-sync/start` (start/restart), `POST /api/admin/analyst-sync/process-next` (chunk of 10, 1200ms pacing), `GET /api/admin/analyst-sync/latest` (polling). Sync result: 100/100 Nasdaq 100 stocks succeeded; 16 have FMP target price data (FMP free plan coverage limitation — 84 return empty array, stored as null); all 100 have Finnhub recommendation rating and count. Upside calculated internally from stored quote: `((targetMean - price) / price) × 100`. Admin Sync Actions tab: added Analyst Data Sync section with Start/Continue/Restart chunked UX. Sync History: records `analyst-data-nasdaq100-sync` with `provider=fmp+finnhub`. Data Inventory: added 9 analyst columns (Has Analyst, Target Price, Upside %, Rating, Count, Target High, Target Low, Source, Last Synced) with 2 new summary cards. Scanner: added Target, Upside, Rating columns; sort by Analyst Upside and Target Price; Min Analyst Upside filter; High Analyst Upside pill (≥20%); Analyst Data section in expanded row. Fixed ScannerTable React key prop warning (fragment changed from `<>` to `<React.Fragment key={...}>`). Dashboard: added 2 analyst summary cards (With Analyst Data, Avg Analyst Upside); added Top Analyst Upside table (top 10 by upside%). Score Methodology tab: added Analyst Data section noting data is collected but not yet scored. Dashboard freshness bug fixed: `lastScoreCalc` query was requiring `status="success"` but Fundamental Score action always writes `status="partial_success"` (skipped stocks without metrics); fixed to `status: { in: ["success","partial_success"] }, successCount: { gt: 0 }`; improved warning messages. Opportunity Score v1 formula unchanged. No provider calls from Scanner or Dashboard. Build passes, `tsc --noEmit` zero errors, `prisma validate` valid, `prisma migrate status` clean. Known issue: FMP free plan covers only 16 of 100 Nasdaq 100 symbols for price-target-summary; remaining 84 show N/A for target price and upside. Approved by user.
- Phase 15 completed (2026-06-01): Quota-Safe Analyst Target Discovery Sync. Added `targetStatus`, `targetLastAttemptedAt`, `targetLastFoundAt`, `targetNextRetryAt`, `targetAttemptCount`, `targetLastMessage` fields to `StockAnalystData` via migration `20260528133632_add_target_discovery_fields`. Created three API routes (`POST /api/admin/analyst-target-discovery/start`, `POST /api/admin/analyst-target-discovery/process-next`, `GET /api/admin/analyst-target-discovery/latest`) and `src/lib/data/admin-analyst-target.ts` with eligible symbol selector and cooldown constants. Run limits: MAX_ATTEMPTS_PER_RUN=40, MAX_TARGETS_FOUND_PER_RUN=16, CHUNK_SIZE=10. Eligible symbol priority: not_checked → provider_error (1d retry) → stale has_target (14d) → no_target_available (30d) → plan_limited (90d). FMP HTTP 402 classified as `plan_limited` (not `provider_error`) with 90-day retry, counted as skipped not failed, existing target data preserved. FMP 429 stops run as `quota_blocked` with 1-day retry. 5xx/network errors remain `provider_error` with 1-day retry. Admin Sync Actions tab: added Analyst Target Discovery section with Start/Continue/Restart chunked UX, quota-safe badge, and cooldown info including plan_limited note. Data Inventory: added `plan-limited` filter pill, Plan Limited summary card (blue), `plan_limited` status rendered in blue distinct from red `provider_error`; `eligible-target-retry` filter explicitly excludes `plan_limited`. Dashboard and Scanner unchanged — no provider calls added, Opportunity Score unchanged. QA result: 40 symbols classified as `plan_limited` in first run (0 provider_error today), targetNextRetryAt ≈ 2026-08-30 for all plan_limited records, has_target records untouched (HAS_TARGET_TOUCHED_TODAY=0). Known issue (pre-existing, not caused by this phase): 19 has_target records from May 28 have null targetMean/targetPrice — suggests FMP may return target data under a different field name than expected; to investigate before Phase 16. Build passes, tsc --noEmit zero errors, prisma validate valid. Approved by user.
- Phase 16 completed (2026-06-01): Sync Architecture Cleanup & Workflow Refactor. Reorganized Admin Sync UI into clean product-level workflows. Renamed page title from "Market Data Sync" to "Admin Sync". Restructured Sync Actions tab into four clearly labeled sections: Universe Sync (badge: Manual / Weekly, button: "Sync Stock Universe"), Daily Market Data Sync (badge: Daily, button: "Sync Daily Market Data"), Company Data Sync (badge: Weekly / Slow-changing, button: "Sync Company Data"), and Score Calculation. Moved Analyst Target Discovery out of the main workflow into a new collapsible "Developer / Legacy Tools" section (collapsed by default, labeled "Not production workflows", "Legacy" badge). All existing sync handlers, progress panels (ChunkedSyncProgressPanel, PausedSyncPanel, ChunkedSyncResultPanel), Continue/Restart behavior, elapsed timers, polling logic, and Sync History remain fully intact. No API routes changed. No Prisma migration. No duplicate models. No temporary files. Build passes, tsc --noEmit zero errors, prisma validate valid, prisma migrate status clean (12 migrations, up to date). Browser QA passed: /admin/sync, /scanner, and / all load correctly. Approved by user.
- Phase 17 completed (2026-06-01): FMP Company Data Sync Migration. Fixed the field mapping bug from Phase 14/15 where FMP `/stable/price-target-summary` was incorrectly used as a source for targetMean/targetHigh/targetLow/targetMedian (those fields do not exist in that endpoint). Added `fetchFmpPriceTargetConsensus` to `fmp.ts` (calls `/stable/price-target-consensus` which correctly returns targetConsensus, targetHigh, targetLow, targetMedian). Enforced clean provider boundaries: `fmp.ts` contains only FMP calls, `finnhub.ts` contains only Finnhub calls (removed FMP call that was inside `fetchFinnhubAnalystData`). Provider composition moved into `app/api/admin/analyst-sync/process-next/route.ts` which calls `fetchFmpPriceTargetConsensus` + `fetchFinnhubAnalystData` in parallel per symbol and combines results before upsert. Updated upsert to set `targetStatus`, `targetLastFoundAt`, `targetLastAttemptedAt` — repairs old bad rows where `targetStatus = has_target` but `targetPrice = null`. SyncRun type kept as `analyst-data-nasdaq100-sync` (changing would break history/polling); UI label remains "Company Data Sync". SyncRun.provider = `fmp+finnhub`. Updated SyncPageClient.tsx description to reflect FMP consensus as source. Updated ScoreMethodologyTab.tsx to Phase 17 analyst data source table. Legacy Analyst Target Discovery remains in Developer/Legacy Tools with updated labels. No Prisma migration needed (all StockAnalystData fields existed). QA results: pre-sync targetPrice=0/100, bad rows=19; post-sync targetPrice=100/100, targetHigh=100/100, targetLow=100/100, targetMedian=100/100, analystUpsidePercent=100/100, bad rows=0. All 11 SyncRun types unaffected. Scores unchanged (avg fundamental=64.2, avg opportunity=60.3). Build passes, tsc --noEmit zero errors, prisma validate valid, prisma migrate status clean (12 migrations). Approved by user.
