# Phase 13 — Opportunity Score v1

## Status

Completed (2026-05-24)

---

## Goal

Add the first version of **Opportunity Score**.

The current app can already answer:

```txt
Which companies are fundamentally strong?
```

through:

```txt
Fundamental Score
Growth Score
Profitability Score
Valuation Score
Financial Health Score
Risk / Context Score
```

Opportunity Score should answer a different question:

```txt
Which fundamentally strong stocks look attractive as investment opportunities right now, based on the data we already have?
```

The score should combine:

```txt
Company quality
Valuation attractiveness
Growth strength
Risk/context
Price position
```

This phase should not add new external provider calls.

---

## Why This Phase Is Needed

After Phases 9–12, the app has:

- Nasdaq 100 universe.
- Real quote data.
- Finnhub basic financial metrics.
- Fundamental Score.
- Scanner connected to real data.
- Dashboard connected to real data.
- Admin sync and Data Inventory.

However, **Fundamental Score alone is not enough**.

A company can be excellent but still expensive.

Example:

```txt
High Fundamental Score
High Growth
High Profitability
But very expensive valuation
```

Opportunity Score should help separate:

```txt
Great company
```

from:

```txt
Great company at a reasonable or attractive setup
```

---

## Product Direction

Opportunity Score v1 should be:

```txt
Deterministic
Explainable
DB-backed
Based only on existing data
Useful for sorting and filtering in Scanner
```

It should not be an AI recommendation or buy/sell signal.

It should be a ranking tool.

---

## Important Scope Decision

Use only the data already stored in the DB.

Allowed:

```txt
StockQuote
StockMetric
StockScore
StockUniverseMember
Stock
```

Not allowed in this phase:

```txt
New provider calls
Analyst target/upside
News catalyst
Technical indicators
Historical candles
Volume anomaly
AI analysis
New sync jobs
Scanner provider calls
```

---

## Difference Between Fundamental Score and Opportunity Score

### Fundamental Score

Answers:

```txt
How strong is the company?
```

Mainly based on:

```txt
Growth
Profitability
Valuation
Financial Health
Risk / Context
```

### Opportunity Score

Answers:

```txt
How attractive is this stock as an opportunity right now, using available fundamentals, valuation, and price context?
```

It should give more importance to:

```txt
Valuation
Growth-adjusted valuation
Price position
Risk-adjusted quality
```

---

## Opportunity Score v1 Formula

Recommended initial weights:

| Component | Weight | Purpose |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| Fundamental Quality | 35% | Avoid ranking weak companies highly just because they are cheap |
| Valuation Attractiveness | 30% | Reward reasonable pricing |
| Growth Strength | 20% | Reward companies still growing |
| Risk / Context | 10% | Penalize excessive risk |
| Price Position / 52W Context | 5% | Small timing/context signal |

Total:

```txt
100%
```

---

## Component Mapping

### 1. Fundamental Quality — 35%

Use existing:

```txt
StockScore.fundamentalScore
```

This is already a 0–100 score.

Purpose:

```txt
The opportunity must be grounded in company quality.
```

### 2. Valuation Attractiveness — 30%

Use existing:

```txt
StockScore.valuationScore
```

Optionally enrich with raw metrics if needed:

```txt
StockMetric.forwardPE
StockMetric.peBasicExclExtraTTM
StockMetric.pegTTM
StockMetric.forwardPEG
StockMetric.evEbitdaTTM
```

For v1, prefer using:

```txt
valuationScore
```

because it already summarizes valuation safely.

### 3. Growth Strength — 20%

Use existing:

```txt
StockScore.growthScore
```

Purpose:

```txt
A cheap stock with no growth may not be a good opportunity.
```

### 4. Risk / Context — 10%

Use existing:

```txt
StockScore.riskContextScore
```

Purpose:

```txt
Avoid over-rewarding high-risk names.
```

### 5. Price Position / 52W Context — 5%

Use:

```txt
StockQuote.price
StockMetric.week52High
StockMetric.week52Low
```

This should be a small score that rewards stocks not too close to extreme overextension, without punishing strong companies too aggressively.

---

## Price Position Scoring

Calculate where the current price sits between 52-week low and 52-week high.

Formula:

```txt
position = (price - week52Low) / (week52High - week52Low)
```

Interpretation:

```txt
0.00 = near 52-week low
1.00 = near 52-week high
```

Suggested scoring:

| Position | Score | Meaning |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| 0.20–0.60 | 100 | Attractive / not overextended |
| 0.60–0.80 | 75 | Reasonable |
| 0.80–0.95 | 50 | Extended |
| > 0.95 | 30 | Very close to 52W high |
| 0.00–0.20 | 60 | Cheap but possibly weak/downtrend |
| Invalid/missing | null | Exclude from final weighted average |

Why not give 100 near the low?

Because a stock close to its 52-week low may be cheap, but it can also be structurally weak. Without technical/news context, avoid over-rewarding it.

---

## Score Calculation Rules

### Output Scale

Store Opportunity Score as:

```txt
0–100
```

### Missing Data Handling

If a component is missing:

- Do not treat it as zero.
- Exclude it from the weighted average.
- Re-normalize remaining weights.

Example:

If price position is missing, calculate from the other 95% of available weights.

### Caps

Do not cap raw data in DB.

Any caps or ranges should apply only inside scoring helper functions.

### No Fake Values

Do not create opportunity values for stocks missing fundamental score.

If there is no `fundamentalScore`, skip the stock.

---

## DB / StockScore Changes

Use existing `StockScore` model.

Add fields only if they do not already exist.

Expected new fields:

```txt
opportunityScore
opportunityScoreVersion
opportunityCalculatedAt
```

Optional component fields if useful:

```txt
opportunityQualityComponent
opportunityValuationComponent
opportunityGrowthComponent
opportunityRiskComponent
opportunityPricePositionComponent
```

Recommendation:

Add only:

```txt
opportunityScore
opportunityScoreVersion
opportunityCalculatedAt
```

Do not over-expand schema in v1.

If component debugging is needed, it can be shown live from existing scores.

Migration expected:

```txt
add_opportunity_score_fields
```

---

## Score Version

Use version:

```txt
opportunity-v1
```

Store in:

```txt
opportunityScoreVersion
```

---

## Calculation Target

Add an Admin action:

```txt
Calculate Opportunity Scores
```

Location:

```txt
/admin/sync → Sync Actions → Score Calculation
```

This action should:

1. Find stocks with `StockScore.fundamentalScore`.
2. Include quote and metrics needed for price position.
3. Calculate Opportunity Score.
4. Update existing `StockScore`.
5. Persist SyncRun / SyncRunItem logging.
6. Return counts:
   - requested
   - calculated
   - skipped
   - failed

Provider:

```txt
internal
```

SyncRun type:

```txt
opportunity-score-calculation
```

No external API calls.

---

## Admin UI

### Sync Actions

Update the Score Calculation section.

Current:

```txt
Calculate Fundamental Scores
```

Add:

```txt
Calculate Opportunity Scores
```

Helper text:

```txt
Calculates Opportunity Score v1 from stored Fundamental Score, valuation, growth, risk/context, and 52-week price position. No external APIs.
```

Badge:

```txt
Internal
```

or:

```txt
Writes to DB
```

Use existing progress/result patterns.

---

## Data Inventory Updates

Add columns:

| Column | Source |
| --- | --- |
| Opportunity Score | Internal |
| Opportunity Version | Internal |
| Opportunity Calculated | Internal |
| 52W Position | Internal / Derived |

Optional:

```txt
Price Position Score
```

Only add if useful and not too crowded.

---

## Scanner Updates

Update `/scanner` to support Opportunity Score.

### Add Column

Add:

```txt
Opportunity
```

Recommended placement:

```txt
Symbol
Sector
Price
Day %
Opportunity
Fundamental
Growth
Profitability
Valuation
Health
Risk
...
```

### Add Sort

Add sort option:

```txt
Opportunity Score
```

Do not make it the default yet unless approved.

Recommended default remains:

```txt
Fundamental Score desc
```

Alternative after QA:

```txt
Opportunity Score desc
```

For this phase, keep default as Fundamental Score unless explicitly changed.

### Add Filter Pill

Add real-data pill:

```txt
High Opportunity
```

Suggested logic:

```txt
opportunityScore >= 75
```

### Add Threshold Filter

Add dropdown:

```txt
Min Opportunity
Any / 50+ / 60+ / 70+ / 80+ / 90+
```

### Expandable Details

Add Opportunity Score to the score breakdown section.

Show formula explanation briefly:

```txt
Opportunity combines fundamental quality, valuation, growth, risk/context, and price position.
```

---

## Dashboard Updates

Update Dashboard minimally.

Add:

- Average Opportunity Score.
- Stocks Above Opportunity 75.
- Top Opportunities table or add Opportunity column to Top Fundamental Stocks.

Recommended:

```txt
Do not replace Top Fundamental Stocks yet.
Add Opportunity Score as an additional column.
```

If adding a separate table, keep it compact:

```txt
Top Opportunities
Top 10 by opportunityScore desc
```

Do not overbuild Dashboard.

---

## Score Methodology Tab Update

Update Admin `Score Methodology` tab.

Add section:

```txt
Opportunity Score v1
```

Include:

- What Opportunity Score means.
- Difference from Fundamental Score.
- Weights:
  - Fundamental Quality 35%
  - Valuation 30%
  - Growth 20%
  - Risk / Context 10%
  - Price Position 5%
- 52-week price position explanation.
- Missing data handling.
- Version:
  ```txt
  opportunity-v1
  ```
- Future improvements:
  - Analyst target/upside.
  - Technical trend.
  - Relative volume.
  - News/catalyst.
  - Sector-relative valuation.

---

## Data Integrity Requirements

Do not:

- Recalculate Fundamental Score.
- Change Fundamental Score formula.
- Create Opportunity Score for stocks missing fundamentalScore.
- Use fake analyst upside.
- Use mock catalyst data.
- Treat missing components as zero.
- Call providers from calculation.
- Call providers from Scanner/Dashboard.

---

## History

- Initial Next.js setup: Cleaned up boilerplate by keeping only H1 in `page.tsx`, removed default CSS styles in `globals.css` while keeping Tailwind import, deleted default SVG files, committed changes, and pushed to GitHub repository.
- Planned dashboard implementation in multiple phases.
- Current feature defined as Phase 1: Dashboard Static Layout with Mock Data.
- Phase 1 completed (2026-05-11): Built full dashboard shell with sidebar, top bar, and all 10 widgets using mock data only. Installed lucide-react. Created `src/lib/formatters.ts` and all components under `src/components/layout/` and `src/components/dashboard/`. Polish pass: fixed Today's Signal copy, separated setup status from catalyst in mock data, changed logo accent to emerald, added bottom scroll padding. Build passes with zero TypeScript errors. Approved by user.
- Phase 2 completed (2026-05-12): Added right-side stock preview drawer. Clicking a row in `HotStocksTable` highlights the row and slides in a 520px drawer from the right. Drawer includes: sticky header (symbol, price, badges, close button), Decision Snapshot, Hot and Opportunity score cards, AI Insight, Price Context (mock SVG chart with timeframe pills), Score Breakdown (progress bars), Main Catalyst, Watch Context (watchlist vs non-watchlist states), and sticky CTA footer. Added `StockDrawerDetail` type and `mockStockDrawerDetails` to `mock-data.ts`. Created `DashboardGrid.tsx` as a client component managing selected stock state and close animation timing. Slide-in and slide-out animations registered via Tailwind v4 `@theme` directive. Row de-selects and drawer closes with exit animation when re-clicking the same row or pressing X. Build passes with zero TypeScript errors. Approved by user.
- Phase 3 completed (2026-05-12): Implemented drawer action flows — Add to Watchlist, Edit Watchlist, and Create Alert — as inline panels inside the existing stock preview drawer. Created `src/types/drawer.ts` for local state types. Created four new components under `src/components/dashboard/drawer/`: `AddToWatchlistPanel.tsx`, `EditWatchlistPanel.tsx`, `CreateAlertPanel.tsx`, and `DrawerSuccessMessage.tsx`. Updated `StockPreviewDrawer.tsx` to manage `activeDrawerAction` and `successMessage` state, render the active panel at the top of the scrollable area, update Watch Context from local state, and wire all CTA footer buttons. Updated `DashboardGrid.tsx` to hold `localWatchlistEntries` state and pass it down with callbacks. Updated `HotStocksTable.tsx` to accept a `watchlistSymbols` set so table stars update immediately when a stock is added locally. Drawer slide animation switched from CSS keyframe class-swapping (unreliable on persistent DOM elements) to a CSS transition approach using `translate-x` and `opacity` with a `requestAnimationFrame` mount trigger. Build passes with zero TypeScript errors. Approved by user.
- Phase 4 completed (2026-05-12): Made the existing dashboard and stock preview drawer responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile. Created `ClientAppShell.tsx` to manage mobile sidebar state and backdrop. Updated `AppSidebar.tsx` to slide in from the left on mobile with a close button, always visible on `md+`. Updated `TopBar.tsx` with a hamburger menu button on mobile and a second-row search input. Updated `app/page.tsx` to use `ClientAppShell`. Made `MarketStatsGrid` 2-column on mobile and `SummaryCardsGrid` single-column on mobile. Updated `DashboardGrid.tsx` to stack to a single column on mobile. Created `MobileHotStockCard.tsx` for mobile Hot Stocks display. Updated `HotStocksTable.tsx` to hide the wide table on mobile and show mobile cards instead. Updated `StockPreviewDrawer.tsx` to be full-screen on mobile (`fixed inset-0`) and right-side 520px panel on desktop. Added scroll-to-top behavior when opening a drawer action panel from the sticky footer using a `scrollContainerRef`. Build passes with zero TypeScript errors. Approved by user.
- Phase 5 completed (2026-05-17): Added Prisma 7 data layer foundation with PostgreSQL (Neon). Installed `prisma`, `@prisma/client`, `@prisma/adapter-pg`, `pg`, `tsx`, `dotenv`. Created `prisma/schema.prisma` with 13 models (Stock, StockQuote, StockScore, StockDrawerDetail, WatchlistItem, User, AlertRule, MarketStat, DashboardSummaryCard, DiscoverSetup, AiInsight, RecentAlert, plus enums). Configured Prisma 7 with `prisma.config.ts` (dotenv loading + datasource URL — required because Prisma 7 no longer supports `url` in schema.prisma). Created `src/lib/db/prisma.ts` as a singleton PrismaClient using `@prisma/adapter-pg`. Created `prisma/seed.ts` seeding all dashboard data (user, market stats, summary cards, 5 hot stocks with quotes/scores/drawer details, 3 extra stocks for top score changes, watchlist items, discover setups, AI insights, recent alerts). Created `src/lib/data/dashboard.ts` with `getDashboardData()` server-side loader. Updated `app/page.tsx` to be an async server component calling `getDashboardData()` and passing data as props; marked `force-dynamic` to prevent static pre-rendering. Updated all dashboard components to accept data as props instead of importing from `mock-data.ts` — type-only imports from `mock-data.ts` remain (types are still defined there); `TodaysSignalCard` still uses `mockTodaysSignal` as there is no DB model for the signal yet. Applied migration and seed to both dev (`ep-dry-river`) and prod (`ep-red-block`) Neon databases. Seed is idempotent (upserts by unique keys; AiInsight/RecentAlert/SummaryCard use deleteMany+createMany). Add/Edit/Alert drawer actions remain local-only. Build passes with zero TypeScript errors. Approved by user.
- Phase 6 completed (2026-05-18): Replaced local-only drawer actions with DB-backed Server Actions and Prisma. Created `src/lib/data/current-user.ts` with `getCurrentUserForDemo()` helper (looks up demo user by email, easy to swap for real auth later). Created `src/lib/validation/drawer-actions.ts` with Zod schemas for all four mutations. Created `src/actions/drawer-actions.ts` with four server actions: `addStockToWatchlist` (upsert via `userId_stockId` composite key), `updateWatchlistItem` (find by composite key then update by id), `removeStockFromWatchlist` (find then delete by id), `createAlertRule` (create with stock/user lookup). Prisma 7 enum values used as string literals with `as const` (Prisma 7 does not re-export enums from `@prisma/client`). Added `ActiveAlertRule` exported type and `alertRulesBySymbol: Record<string, ActiveAlertRule[]>` to `getDashboardData()` in `dashboard.ts`; the alert rule query runs separately after the 9-element `Promise.all` to avoid TypeScript tuple inference breakage at 10+ elements. Threaded `alertRulesBySymbol` through `app/page.tsx` → `DashboardGrid` → `StockPreviewDrawer` → `CreateAlertPanel`. Added "Alert Active" amber badge to drawer header when `existingAlerts.length > 0`. Added existing alerts list inside `CreateAlertPanel` with `formatAlertType` / `formatFrequency` helpers. Added Remove from Watchlist button at the bottom of `EditWatchlistPanel` (red-tinted text, trash icon, separate `useTransition` from save). All mutations call `router.refresh()` on success to reload server data; `DashboardGrid` syncs `selectedStock` from refreshed `hotStocks` prop via `useEffect`. No new Prisma models added, no migration created — existing Phase 5 schema was sufficient. Build passes with zero TypeScript errors. `prisma validate` and `prisma migrate status` both pass clean. Approved by user.
- Phase 7 completed (2026-05-18): Built the Scanner page foundation at `/scanner`. Created `src/lib/data/scanner.ts` with `getScannerData()` server-side loader using existing Prisma models (Stock, StockQuote, StockScore, StockDrawerDetail, WatchlistItem, AlertRule). Created `app/scanner/page.tsx` as a dynamic server component. Created 7 scanner-specific components under `src/components/scanner/`: `ScannerPageClient.tsx` (client state manager), `ScannerHeader.tsx`, `ScannerViewPills.tsx` (8 preset views: All Stocks, Hot Today, Strong Momentum, Best Opportunities, Unusual Volume, FOMO Risk, In Watchlist, Alert Active), `ScannerControls.tsx` (search input + sort dropdown + result count), `ScannerFilters.tsx` (Sector / Risk / Setup dropdowns + Watchlist / Alert Active toggles + Clear), `ScannerTable.tsx` (desktop 13-column table with hover and selected-row state), `MobileScannerCard.tsx` (mobile stock cards). Client-side filtering and sorting (Best Signal formula, Hot Score, Opp Score, Daily Change, Relative Volume, Analyst Upside, Symbol). Reused existing `StockPreviewDrawer` from the dashboard without modification — all drawer actions (Add/Edit/Remove Watchlist, Create Alert) work identically from the Scanner. Updated `AppSidebar.tsx` to use `usePathname()` and `Link` for dynamic active nav state so Scanner nav item highlights correctly. Added `showSearch` prop to `TopBar` and `ClientAppShell` (defaults `true`) and passed `showSearch={false}` from the scanner page to hide the redundant TopBar search on `/scanner`. No new Prisma models, no migration, no schema changes. No duplicate server actions. Build passes with zero TypeScript errors. `prisma validate` and `prisma migrate status` both pass clean. Approved by user.
- Phase 8 completed (2026-05-19): Added database-backed market universe support to the Scanner. Added `StockUniverseType` enum, `StockUniverse` and `StockUniverseMember` models to `prisma/schema.prisma`; added `universeMemberships` relation on `Stock`. Applied migration `20260519115623_add_stock_universes`. Updated `prisma/seed.ts` to create/upsert three system universes (Russell 1000 as `BASE_UNIVERSE` with `isDefault=true`, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 as `INDEX`) and assign all 8 seeded stocks to Russell 1000 with demo sub-membership (NVDA/AMD/TSLA → S&P 500 + Nasdaq 100, PLTR → S&P 500, SMCI/SOFI/KVYO/MHNI → Russell 1000 only). Seed is fully idempotent. Updated `getScannerData()` to accept `universeSlug` param (defaults to `russell-1000`), filter stocks by universe membership, include per-stock membership slugs, and derive `isSp500`, `isNasdaq100`, `isRussell1000`, `isRussell1000Only` flags — `isRussell1000Only` is computed, not stored. Scanner page reads `?universe=<slug>` query param and passes available universes and selected slug to the client. Added Universe selector strip (Globe icon, shows base universes, highlights active). Added Index filter dropdown (All Indexes / S&P 500 / Nasdaq 100 / Russell 1000 Only) to `ScannerFilters`; clear filters resets it to All. Added compact index badge below stock name in `ScannerTable` symbol cell and in `MobileScannerCard`. Added five optional universe fields to `HotStock` type in `mock-data.ts` (no dashboard impact). No external APIs, no real index import, no scoring engine, no price-eligibility rules. All existing scanner/drawer/dashboard behavior preserved. Build passes with zero TypeScript errors. `prisma validate` and `prisma migrate status` both pass clean. Seed idempotency verified by running twice. Approved by user.
- Phase 9B completed (2026-05-19): Built the market data provider layer and admin manual sync shell. Created shared provider types in `src/lib/market-data/types.ts` (`MarketDataProvider`, `ProviderTestResult`, `NormalizedQuote`, `NormalizedCompanyProfile`, `NormalizedNewsItem`, `SyncSummary`). Created three server-side-only provider clients: `providers/fmp.ts` (`testFmpProfile`, `fetchFmpCompanyProfile`, `fetchFmpAnalystTarget`), `providers/twelve-data.ts` (`testTwelveQuote`, `fetchTwelveQuote`, `fetchTwelveQuotes` batch), `providers/finnhub.ts` (`testFinnhubNews`, `fetchFinnhubCompanyNews`, `fetchFinnhubQuote`). All providers check for missing API key, handle HTTP errors, handle rate limits (429), normalize response shapes, and never expose keys. Created `src/actions/market-data-actions.ts` with five server actions: `testFmpProfileAction`, `testTwelveQuoteAction`, `testFinnhubNewsAction`, `syncQuotesSampleAction` (upserts `StockQuote` for up to 5 DB symbols via Twelve Data), `syncProfilesSampleAction` (updates `Stock.name/sector/marketCap` for up to 5 DB symbols via FMP). Raw provider response bodies stripped from action returns via `stripRaw()` before client serialization. Created `app/admin/sync/page.tsx` (server component, resolves key presence server-side) and `src/components/admin/SyncPageClient.tsx` (client, all 5 action buttons with loading states and result viewer). No schema changes, no new migrations, no existing files modified. `StockQuote.source` and `StockQuote.lastSyncedAt` intentionally not added — noted as a gap for Phase 9D. Build passes, `prisma validate` and `prisma migrate status` both clean. Approved by user.
- Phase 9C completed (2026-05-19): Added safe quote sync metadata, API key validation, and detailed sync reporting. Added `source`, `lastSyncedAt`, `sourceUpdatedAt` fields to `StockQuote` via migration `20260519144031_add_stock_quote_sync_metadata`. Created `src/lib/market-data/safe-update.ts` with `isValidNumber`, `keepExistingIfInvalid` helpers. Updated `src/lib/market-data/types.ts` with `SyncRunStatus`, `SyncSymbolResult`, `SyncActionResult` types replacing the coarse `SyncSummary`. Rewrote `src/actions/market-data-actions.ts` to use safe helpers and return per-symbol success/skipped/failed breakdown; each symbol update is atomic (partial success preserved). Rewrote `src/components/admin/SyncPageClient.tsx` with 4-step workflow layout, button descriptions, DB safety note, empty result placeholder, and clear updated/skipped/failed symbol lists. Added `Admin Sync` nav item to `AppSidebar.tsx` behind `NEXT_PUBLIC_SHOW_ADMIN_TOOLS=true` flag with amber DEV badge and active state. Fixed FMP provider: all `/api/v3/` legacy endpoints return HTTP 403 for non-legacy users (deprecated after August 31, 2025) — replaced with `/stable/profile?symbol=` and `/stable/analyst-estimates?symbol=&period=annual&limit=1`; fixed field mappings (`marketCap` not `mktCap`, `exchange` not `exchangeShortName`). Build passes, `prisma validate` and `prisma migrate status` both clean. QA confirmed: Twelve Data quote sync OK, FMP profile sync OK (all 5 symbols), Finnhub news test OK, partial-success simulation OK, no duplicate rows, no API key exposure, dashboard/scanner/drawer regression clean. Approved by user.
- Phase 9D completed (2026-05-19): Added persistent sync logging for manual market-data sync actions. Added `SyncRun` and `SyncRunItem` Prisma models via migration `20260519191321_add_sync_run_logs`. Created `src/lib/data/admin-sync.ts` with `getRecentSyncRuns(limit = 10)` server loader. Updated `src/actions/market-data-actions.ts` with `persistSyncLog()` helper; both `syncQuotesSampleAction` and `syncProfilesSampleAction` now persist a `SyncRun` + per-symbol `SyncRunItem` rows on every run (including early-failure paths). Updated `src/components/admin/SyncPageClient.tsx`: renamed Step 4 to "Review Results", added Step 5 "Recent Sync Runs" — a table showing the latest 10 runs with green/amber/red status badges, counts, and click-to-expand symbol-level details (symbol, status, reason, dbAction). Updated `app/admin/sync/page.tsx` to load recent sync runs server-side and pass serialised to the client; `router.refresh()` called after each sync to keep the table current. Cascade delete on SyncRunItem. No API keys, URLs, or raw provider payloads stored. Safe update behavior unchanged. Build passes, `prisma validate` and `prisma migrate status` both clean. Full QA passed: schema verified, persist logic audited on all code paths, security confirmed, no regressions. Approved by user.
- Phase 9E completed (2026-05-21): Added universe management and Nasdaq 100 membership sync with Admin visibility and UX improvements. Extended `StockUniverseMember` with active/inactive membership metadata (`isActive`, `lastSeenAt`, `removedAt`, `source`, `statusReasonCode`) via migration `20260521135955_add_universe_membership_status`. Added a manually validated Nasdaq 100 static fallback source in `src/lib/market-data/nasdaq100-fallback-symbols.ts` with 100 unique symbols and explicit metadata (`source = static_fallback`, `compositionAsOf = 2026-01-20`, `lastVerifiedAt = 2026-05-21`); FMP and Finnhub live constituent endpoints were investigated but unavailable on the current plans, so FMP is used only for profile enrichment. Added `fetchFmpNasdaq100Constituents()` flow using the fallback symbols plus FMP profile enrichment, and added `syncNasdaq100UniverseAction()` to create missing stocks, create/reactivate/deactivate Nasdaq 100 memberships, persist `SyncRun`/`SyncRunItem` logs, and never delete stocks or modify watchlist/alerts. Created `src/lib/data/admin-universes.ts` with `getUniverseOverview()` and `getDbStockSummary()` loaders. Updated `/admin/sync` with DB Stock Summary, Universe Overview, static fallback source banner, and a `Sync Nasdaq 100 Universe` action. Manual QA confirmed the sync creates/maintains 100 active Nasdaq 100 members, preserves existing stocks/watchlist/alerts, stores `StockUniverseMember.source = static_fallback`, stores `SyncRun.provider = static_fallback`, and keeps profile enrichment separate from membership source. Added Admin Sync UX polish before commit: reorganized `/admin/sync` into four tabs (`Overview`, `Sync Actions`, `Provider Tests`, `Sync History`), added an in-progress panel for long-running write actions with elapsed timer and indeterminate progress bar, disabled duplicate submissions while sync is running, and kept all existing provider tests, sample syncs, review results, and sync history intact. Build passes, `tsc`, `prisma validate`, and `prisma migrate status` all clean. Approved by user.
- Phase 9F completed (2026-05-22): Added controlled Nasdaq 100 quote snapshot batch sync. Added `open`, `dayHigh`, `dayLow`, `previousClose` to `StockQuote` via migration `20260522062445_add_quote_ohlc_fields`. Added `getNextNasdaq100QuoteBatch(limit=25)` selector in `admin-universes.ts` (missing quotes first, then oldest `lastSyncedAt`, then symbol ASC). Refactored quote sync into shared `syncQuotesForSymbols()` helper reused by both `syncQuotesSampleAction` and new `syncNasdaq100QuoteSnapshotsAction`. New action uses Finnhub as provider (sequential per-symbol calls, safe update behavior, 429 detection), persists `SyncRun` with `type=quotes-nasdaq100-batch` and `provider=finnhub`, and persists `SyncRunItem` per symbol. Added `quoteRefreshCycleSynced` field to `UniverseOverviewRow` using a SyncRun running-total cycle boundary algorithm (scans batch runs oldest→newest, accumulates successCount, resets when total reaches activeCount — correctly tracks 25→50→75→100 progression). Admin Sync Actions tab shows new button with inline in-progress panel (appears directly below button, no scrolling needed). Overview tab shows two-part Nasdaq 100 coverage: Part A (quote coverage count, always visible), Part B (current refresh cycle progress, visible only when missing=0). Fixed Finnhub Unix timestamp conversion (`raw.t * 1000`). Build passes, `tsc`, `prisma validate`, and `prisma migrate status` all clean. Approved by user.
- Phase 9G completed (2026-05-22): Added Data Inventory tab to `/admin/sync`. Created `src/lib/data/admin-stock-data.ts` with `getAdminStockDataInventory()` — queries all stocks with `quote`, `score`, `universeMemberships` (including `universe.slug`), `watchlistItems`, and `alertRules` in a single Prisma query; derives `scannerEligible`, `missingReason`, `volumeSourceLabel`, and `quoteSourceLabel` server-side; formats all values as strings. Created `src/components/admin/DataInventoryTab.tsx` as a client component with: 6 summary cards (Total Stocks, With Quote, Missing Quote, With Score, Scanner Eligible, Nasdaq 100 Active); symbol/company text search; filter pills (All / Scanner Eligible / Missing Score / Missing Quote / Nasdaq 100); 24-column table with a two-row header (parameter name + source label). Columns cover Identity (Symbol, Company Name, Sector, Market Cap), Universe (Nasdaq 100, Univ. Source, Mbr Active, Mbr Last Seen), Quote (Has Quote, Price, Change %, Open, Day High, Day Low, Prev Close, Volume, Quote Source, Last Synced, Src Updated), and Internal (Has Score, Scanner Eligible, Missing Reason, In Watchlist, Active Alert). Volume is labeled `N/A` when null and `Mixed` when the quote source is Finnhub but a prior value exists — Finnhub is never incorrectly credited as the volume source. Tab order: Overview → Data Inventory → Sync Actions → Provider Tests → Sync History. No new Prisma models, no migrations. Build passes, `tsc`, `prisma validate`, and `prisma migrate status` all clean. Approved by user.
- Phase 9H-A completed (2026-05-22): Finnhub Basic Financials Research. Inspected `src/lib/market-data/providers/finnhub.ts`. Created and deleted a temporary script `tmp_research_finnhub.mjs`. No production code was changed. Tested endpoints `/stock/metric`, `/stock/price-target`, `/stock/recommendation`, `/calendar/earnings`, `/stock/profile2` on symbols AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, AMD, TSLA. Full findings below. No DB schema changes, no sync actions, no Scanner changes, no commits.
- Phase 9H-B completed (2026-05-23): Nasdaq 100 Quote + Basic Financials Sync. Added `StockMetric` Prisma model (28 Decimal? fields: growth, profitability, financial strength, valuation, market/risk context; `stockId @unique`; `provider`, `rawMetricCount`, `lastSyncedAt`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`) via migration `20260522154752_add_stock_metrics`. Added `fetchFinnhubBasicFinancials(symbol)` to `src/lib/market-data/providers/finnhub.ts` mapping 28 Finnhub metric fields with bracket notation for `totalDebt/totalEquityAnnual`, `52WeekHigh`, `52WeekLow`; Finnhub `marketCapitalization` (millions) multiplied by 1,000,000 before storing; percentage fields stored as-is (47.86 = 47.86%). Added `getNextNasdaq100MarketDataBatch(limit=25)` selector in `src/lib/data/admin-universes.ts` (priority: missing metrics → missing quotes → oldest metric sync → oldest quote sync → symbol ASC). Added `syncNasdaq100MarketDataAction()` to `src/actions/market-data-actions.ts` (type=`market-data-nasdaq100-batch`, provider=`finnhub`; 2 Finnhub calls per symbol — quote + metric; 500ms delay between symbols; stops on 429 rate-limit with partial-success persistence; safe-update pattern: create uses `safeNum() ?? undefined`, update uses `safeNum() ?? existingMetric?.field ?? null`; non-null assertion on required `price` field confirmed valid by preceding `isValidNumber` guard; persists `SyncRun` + `SyncRunItem` per symbol with per-field outcome messages). Extended `AdminStockDataInventoryRow` type and `getAdminStockDataInventory()` in `src/lib/data/admin-stock-data.ts` with 30+ metric fields (metric relation included in Prisma query; percentage fields suffixed with `%`; market cap formatted as `$X.XXB`). Updated `src/components/admin/DataInventoryTab.tsx`: added 20+ metric columns across Growth, Profitability, Financial Strength, and Valuation/Market sections with `Finnhub` source labels; added `Missing Metrics` filter pill; expanded summary cards from 6 to 8 (added With Metrics, Missing Metrics). Updated `src/components/admin/SyncPageClient.tsx`: added `Nasdaq 100 Market Data Sync` section in Sync Actions tab with metrics coverage panel; UX cleanup — removed old quote-only Nasdaq batch button from Sync Actions, removed Sample Sync from Sync Actions, added `Sample DB Writes` section to Provider Tests tab with inline progress panel. `syncNasdaq100QuoteSnapshotsAction` retained in `market-data-actions.ts` (internal use, not exposed in UI). Build passes, `tsc --noEmit` zero errors, `prisma validate` valid, `prisma migrate status` clean. Approved by user.
- Phase 9I completed (2026-05-23): Fundamental Score Foundation + Score Methodology Tab. Added 8 nullable fields to `StockScore` via migration `20260523153618_add_fundamental_score_fields` (`fundamentalScore`, `growthScore`, `profitabilityScore`, `valuationScore`, `financialHealthScore`, `riskContextScore`, `scoreVersion`, `lastCalculatedAt`). Created `src/lib/scoring/fundamental-score.ts` — deterministic scoring engine with 16 metric helper functions, `categoryAverage()` excluding nulls, weight re-normalization for missing categories, ROE cap at 60% and Interest Coverage cap at 30x (scoring only, raw values untouched), version constant `SCORE_VERSION = "fundamental-v1"`. Added `calculateFundamentalScoresAction()` to `src/actions/market-data-actions.ts` — no external API calls, skips stocks without `StockMetric`, upserts `StockScore` preserving existing `hotScore`/`opportunityScore`, persists `SyncRun` (`type=fundamental-score-calculation`, `provider=internal`) + `SyncRunItem` per symbol. Created `src/components/admin/ScoreMethodologyTab.tsx` — 6 sections: overview, category weights, 21-metric scoring rules table, caps/limitations, example calculation (score=72), future improvements. Updated `src/lib/data/admin-stock-data.ts` and `DataInventoryTab.tsx` to include 8 score columns with `Internal` source labels. Updated `SyncPageClient.tsx` to add Score Calculation section (Sync Actions tab) and Score Methodology tab (tab 6). Bug found and fixed during QA: Turbopack dev server had stale Prisma client cache from before `prisma generate` — fixed by clearing `.next/` and re-running `prisma generate`. Result: 100 stocks scored, 0 failed, 101 scanner-eligible, no duplicates, all scores in [0,100]. Build passes, `tsc --noEmit` zero errors, `prisma validate` valid, `prisma migrate status` clean. Approved by user.
- Phase 9J completed (2026-05-24): Resumable Chunked Market Data Sync. Replaced the old long-running Nasdaq 100 full sync (single server action, ~385s) with a scalable chunk-based architecture. Added `processedCount` and `currentSymbol` to `SyncRun` via migration `20260524061553_add_sync_run_progress_fields`. Created three new API routes: `POST /api/admin/sync-runs/start` (creates or restarts SyncRun), `POST /api/admin/sync-runs/process-next` (processes one chunk of 10 stocks), `GET /api/admin/sync-runs/latest` (polling endpoint, updated type). Removed old `syncNasdaq100MarketDataAction` batch server action and all old Next 25 buttons from the UI. Chunk size: 10 stocks per chunk (20 Finnhub calls). Rate-limit strategy: call-start pacing — ≥1100ms between Finnhub call starts (~54 calls/minute). Resume logic: `SyncRunItem` rows for the active `syncRunId` are the source of truth; unprocessed = all active symbols minus already-itemised symbols. Restart creates a new `SyncRun`; previous run remains in history. Auto-continue loop: UI calls `process-next` sequentially while `status === "running"` and `!done`; 2-second polling via `/latest` runs in parallel. ETA: `avgMsPerStock = elapsedMs / processedCount`; shows "Estimating…" until processedCount ≥ 2. Paused state UX: dedicated `PausedSyncPanel` shows paused-at timestamp (`finishedAt`), reason (`message` or fallback), last symbol, processed/total counts, amber progress bar, and guidance text. Rate limit message: "Finnhub rate limit reached. Continue the sync after waiting." Restart message: "Restarted by user before completion." No duplicate `StockQuote`, `StockMetric`, or `SyncRunItem` rows. Score calculation remains a separate explicit step. Scanner unchanged. Build passes, `tsc --noEmit` zero errors, `prisma validate` valid, `prisma generate` run to refresh client types. Approved by user.
- Phase 10 completed (2026-05-24): Scanner Real Data Integration. Moved `/scanner` from 5 demo/seed stocks to 100 real Nasdaq 100 stocks from the DB. Changed default universe from `russell-1000` to `nasdaq-100`; added `isActive: true` membership filter and `metric: true` include to the Prisma query. Added 4 formatter helpers to `src/lib/formatters.ts` (`formatScore`, `formatMetricPercent`, `formatRatio`, `formatCompactCurrency`). Extended `HotStock` type in `mock-data.ts` with 13 new optional fields for fundamental scores and key metrics. Rewrote `ScannerTable.tsx` with 18 real columns (Symbol, Sector, Price, Day%, Fund., Growth, Profit., Valuat., Health, Risk, P/E, PEG, Rev Gr., EPS Gr., ROE, D/E, Mkt Cap). Replaced sort options with 8 fundamental-focused keys; default sort is Fundamental Score descending. Removed Risk and Setup filters (not backed by real data). Reduced view pills to 3 active (All Stocks, In Watchlist, Alert Active); 5 unsupported pills (Hot Today, Strong Momentum, Best Opportunities, Unusual Volume, FOMO Risk) shown as disabled with "Coming soon" tooltips. Updated `MobileScannerCard.tsx` to show fundamental/growth/profitability/health scores and key metrics. Updated `ScannerHeader.tsx` subtitle. Dashboard audited — still uses `hotScore`/`opportunityScore` (= 0 for real stocks); deferred to Phase 11. No Prisma migration needed. No external provider calls added. Browser QA confirmed: 100 stocks loading (META top at Fund=89), all new columns visible with real values, N/A for missing metrics, disabled pills visible, dashboard unbroken. Build passes, `tsc --noEmit` zero errors, `prisma validate` valid, `prisma migrate status` clean. Known issue: universe selector strip shows "Russell 1000" button (only BASE_UNIVERSE type) with no active highlight since selected data is Nasdaq 100 (INDEX type) — UX improvement deferred to Phase 11. Approved by user.
- Phase 11 completed (2026-05-24): Scanner UX & Universe Selector Improvements. Fixed universe selector — Nasdaq 100 shown as active, Russell 1000 and S&P 500 shown as disabled "Coming soon" (backed by DB `hasData` count). Extended `HotStock` type with 20 new optional fields (detail metrics, score metadata, data freshness). Updated `getScannerData()` to map all new fields and compute `hasData` per universe via grouped Prisma query. Rewrote `ScannerTable` with score column tooltips (Info icon + title text), removed D/E and EPS Growth from main table, added expandable row chevron — clicking expands `ScannerExpandedRow` inline without opening the drawer. Created `ScannerExpandedRow` component with 6 grouped sections: Score Breakdown (progress bars + version + last calculated), Growth, Profitability, Valuation, Financial Health, and Data Freshness. Updated `ScannerViewPills` with 4 new active pills: High Fundamentals (≥75), High Growth (≥75), High Profitability (≥75), Reasonable Valuation (≥60). Updated `ScannerFilters` with 5 score threshold dropdowns (Any/50+/60+/70+/80+/90+) and Positive Day% toggle; exported `DEFAULT_FILTERS`. Updated `ScannerControls` with 5 new sort options (Risk Score, P/E, PEG, ROE, Revenue Growth — 13 total). Updated `ScannerPageClient` with new view/threshold filter logic, fixed universe selector rendering, improved empty states (no-match vs no-data). Dashboard deferred to Phase 12. No external provider calls, no schema changes, no Prisma migration. Build passes, TypeScript clean. Approved by user.
- Phase 12 completed (2026-05-24): Dashboard Real Data Cleanup. Fully replaced the legacy/demo dashboard with a real-data overview screen. Rewrote `src/lib/data/dashboard.ts` — removed all seeded-data queries (MarketStat, DashboardSummaryCard, DiscoverSetup, AiInsight, RecentAlert, hotScore-based ordering) and replaced with real Prisma queries across Stock, StockQuote, StockMetric, StockScore, StockUniverseMember, and SyncRun. New `DashboardData` type exports: `DashboardSummary`, `DashboardFreshness`, `DashboardStockRow`, `DashboardSectorRow`, `DashboardWarning`, `DashboardWatchlistItem`. Created 5 new components: `DashboardSummaryCards.tsx` (8 real cards: Total Stocks, Scanner Ready, With Metrics, With Scores, Avg Fundamental, Stocks Above 75, Last Market Sync, Last Score Calc), `TopFundamentalStocksTable.tsx` (top 15 by fundamentalScore desc, with score bars and sub-scores), `SectorSummaryTable.tsx` (avg fundamental/growth/profitability per sector, top stock per sector), `DataCoverageSection.tsx` (progress bars for quotes/metrics/scores/scanner-ready with capped 100% display and "+N rows outside universe" note), `DataWarningsSection.tsx` (amber warnings for missing sync, missing metrics, missing scores, stale scores). Updated `DashboardHeader.tsx` (new subtitle), `DashboardGrid.tsx` (removed legacy widgets, wired new components), `WatchlistWidget.tsx` (shows fundamentalScore instead of hot/opp, uses `DashboardWatchlistItem` type), `app/page.tsx` (removed TodaysSignalCard, MarketStatsGrid, old SummaryCardsGrid; added new components). No Prisma migration added. No external provider calls. No scoring formula changes. Browser QA confirmed: 100 stocks, META top at Fund=89, all legacy fields absent, data warnings functional, coverage bars capped at 100%, sector summary present, watchlist shows Fund scores, Scanner and Admin Sync unbroken. Build passes, `tsc --noEmit` zero errors, `prisma validate` valid, `prisma migrate status` clean. Approved by user.
- Phase 13 completed (2026-05-24): Opportunity Score v1. Added `oppScore Decimal?`, `oppScoreVersion String?`, `oppCalculatedAt DateTime?` to `StockScore` via migration `20260524135513_add_opportunity_score_fields`. Created `src/lib/scoring/opportunity-score.ts` — deterministic scoring engine with weighted average (fundamentalScore 35%, valuationScore 30%, growthScore 20%, riskContextScore 10%, pricePosition 5%), null-exclusion with weight re-normalization for missing components, price position scoring from 52W high/low (`(price - week52Low) / (week52High - week52Low)` → scored 30–100), version constant `OPPORTUNITY_SCORE_VERSION = "opportunity-v1"`. Added `calculateOpportunityScoresAction()` to `src/actions/market-data-actions.ts` — no external calls, skips stocks without fundamentalScore, upserts `StockScore.oppScore`, persists `SyncRun` (`type=opportunity-score-calculation`, `provider=internal`) + `SyncRunItem` per symbol. Fixed Turbopack stale cache bug (same as Phase 9I): cleared `.next/` and re-ran `prisma generate` before QA. Admin Sync Actions tab: added "Calculate Opportunity Scores" button with helper text and Internal badge. Score Methodology tab: added Opportunity Score v1 section with weights, price position table, missing data rules, version. Data Inventory: added Opp. Score, Opp. Version, Opp. Calc At columns. Scanner: added Opp. column (between Day% and Fund.), sort by Opportunity Score, "High Opportunity" pill (≥75), "Min Opp." threshold filter, expanded row shows Opportunity Score section with formula explanation. Dashboard: added "Avg Opportunity" and "High Opportunity" summary cards; added Opp. column to Top Fundamental Stocks table. No external provider calls added. Build passes, `tsc --noEmit` zero errors, `prisma validate` valid, `prisma migrate status` clean. Approved by user.
